A word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase. Used to further develop my JavaScript skills.

Skills used during development:

- HTML

  - Event Listeners

## Features

### Potential future improvements:

1. connect to an API to get a list of random phrases to guess from.
